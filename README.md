# sample-gridview-select
Android gridview with item selection example

Shows how to select ImageView items in GridView with choice modes.

Implementation is done using `CheckedImageView` as a GridView item - this is an `ImageView` that implements `Checkable` interface.
This enables `CheckedImageView` to have a border when in "checked" state.
